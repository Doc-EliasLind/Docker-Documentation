# Sandbox Environment for Safe Internet Browsing

## Purpose of this project

Using Docker to its fullest potential, means that we can virtualize almost anything. That includes dedicated, separate and secure network environments. To keep unsafe internet browsing out of any essential processes and computers, I've created this Docker Container Environment to fulfill the purpose of safe internet access. 

## FAQ

### Does this Container Environment use external internet?

No. It runs completely off a dedicated internal Container Network. Entirely utilising Docker's capabilities.
